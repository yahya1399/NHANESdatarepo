<H2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</H2>
<P>A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (sometimes referred to as the NHANES 
food propensity questionnaire or “FPQ”) was used in NHANES 2003-2004 to collect 
information on the frequency of food consumption during the past 12 months. </P>
<P>Two public data release files were prepared. The FFQ Daily Frequency File 
(SAS name FFQDC_C) described here provides daily food frequency covariates. The 
second file, the FFQ Questionnaire File (SAS name: FFQRAW_C) is described 
separately. The FFQ data augment the other NHANES 2003-2004 dietary assessment 
components which include two 24-hour dietary recall interviews and interview 
information on dietary supplement use, food security, and dietary behavior.</P>
<P><STRONG>FFQ Development And Testing&nbsp;</STRONG></P>
<P>The NHANES FFQ questionnaire was developed by the National Institutes of 
Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI). The basis for the NHANES FFQ is the NCI 
Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ), a 124-item food frequency instrument that is 
widely used in nutritional epidemiology research (Subar 2001a). Unlike the DHQ, 
portion size information was not collected with the NHANES FFQ. The NHANES FFQ 
data were not intended to be used to derive estimates of absolute intake for 
either nutrients or foods. Diet*Calc software was developed by the National 
Cancer Institute (Diet*Calc 2005). Diet*Calc was used to produce daily food 
frequency estimates from the FFQ data.</P>
<H2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</H2>
<P>All English or Spanish-speaking examinees 2+ years of age who completed at 
least one 24-hr dietary recall interview were eligible for the FFQ 
component.</P>
<H2 id="Interview_Setting_and_Mode_of_Administration">Interview Setting and Mode 
of Administration</H2>
<P>Printed FFQ questionnaires were mailed to survey participants’ homes. Proxy 
respondents (usually a parent) completed the questionnaire for children less 
than 6 years of age and proxies assisted children 6-11 years of age and persons 
who could not complete the questionnaire on their own. Subjects 12 years of age 
and over self-reported. A postage-paid envelope was provided to respondents. 
Respondents who returned their FFQ form received $30 remuneration. The FFQ forms 
were scanned at a central office and the scanned data were added to the NHANES 
database. </P>
<P>The Diet*Calc software was used with the scanned FFQ data to produce daily 
frequencies for multiple foods and food groups. The FFQDC_C file contains more 
than 790,000 records. A majority of survey participants have more than 100 
Diet*Calc records.</P>
<H2 id="Quality_Assurance_&amp;_Quality_Control">Quality Assurance &amp; Quality 
Control</H2>
<P>Quality control programs and manual verification checks were used to verify 
the completeness and accuracy of the scanned FFQ data files. All of the scanned 
FFQ records were included in the questionnaire file (FFQRAW_C). The 
questionnaire file documentation describes the methodology which was used to 
determine the completeness of the FFQ data.</P>
<H2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</H2>
<P>None of the completed FFQ questionnaires or data were edited.</P>
<H2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</H2>
<P>Data users should review the NHANES Analytic Guidelines carefully before 
analyzing the FFQ data. Additional guidance will be provided at a later date 
when NHANES website tutorials on NHANES dietary data analysis are available. 
</P>
<P>Two look-up tables are provided for use with the FFQ. The look-up tables 
(file names: FOODLOOK and VARLOOK) provide descriptive text labels for the food 
and variable identification number variables in this file. </P>
<P>A SAS program is provided on the NHANES website to show how to combine the 
descriptive text and frequency data. </P>
<P>The daily frequencies in this file are based on algorithms within Diet*Calc. 
These algorithms assign a daily frequency as follows: </P>
<P>For beverages: </P>
<P>Never = 0 <BR>1 time per month or less = 0.03 <BR>2-3 times per month = 0.08 
<BR>1-2 times per week = 0.21 <BR>3-4 times per week = 0.5 <BR>5-6 times per 
week = 0.79 <BR>1 time per day = 1 <BR>2-3 times per day = 2.5<BR>4-5 times per 
day = 4.5 <BR>6 or more times per day = 7 </P>
<P>For foods: </P>
<P>Never= 0 <BR>1-6 time per year = 0.01 <BR>7-11 times per year = 0.028 <BR>1 
time per month = 0.033 <BR>2-3 times per month = 0.08 <BR>1 time per week = 0.14 
<BR>2 times per week = 0.29 <BR>3-4 times per week = 0.5 <BR>5-6 times per week 
= 0.79 <BR>1 time per day = 1 <BR>2 or more times per day = 2 </P>
<P>For coffee, tea, and additions to coffee and tea: </P>
<P>None= 0 <BR>Less than 1 cup per month = 0.02 <BR>1-3 cups per month = 0.07 
<BR>1 cup per week = 0.14 <BR>2-4 cups per week = 0.43 <BR>5-6 cups per week = 
0.79 <BR>1 cup per day = 1 <BR>2-3 cups per day = 2.5 <BR>4-5 cups per day = 4.5 
<BR>6 or more cups per day = 7 </P>
<P>Proportion Question Algorithms: The proportion question(s) which accompany a 
particular frequency question will also affect the daily frequencies. The 
proportion (P) will act as a multiplier for the specific type of food mentioned 
in the proportion question, and the remaining proportion (1-P) is used as the 
multiplier for the food not specifically mentioned in the proportion question. 
For instance, the proportion question for question 6 would apply the answer 
supplied as a proportion of diet or sugar-free fruit drinks, while the remaining 
proportion would be applied to regular fruit drinks. The multipliers are 
obtained using the following algorithm: </P>
<P>Almost never or never = 0 <BR>About ¼ of the time = 0.25 <BR>About ½ of the 
time = 0.5<BR>About ¾ of the time = 0.75 <BR>Almost always or always = 1 </P>
<P>However, the proportion questions for questions 9, 84 use a different 
algorithm than the one above. For questions 9 and 84, each proportion can apply 
simultaneously for those foods. Using question 9 as an example, here is how the 
algorithm would work: </P>
<P>First proportion (how often soda was diet or sugar-free) = P1 <BR>Second 
proportion (how often soda was caffeine-free) = P2 </P>
<P>Multiplier used for: <BR>Diet, caffeine-free soda = P1 * P2 <BR>Diet, 
caffeinated soda = P1 * (1 – P2) <BR>Regular, caffeine-free soda = (1 – P1) * P2 
<BR>Regular, caffeinated soda = (1 – P1) * (1 – P2) </P>
<P>Seasonal Question Algorithms: for seasonal questions (9, 10, 13, 21, 23, 24, 
25, 26, 35, 42, 43, 97), the following algorithm was used to assign missing 
values:</P>

<P></P>
<P>Several references describing the FFQ development and validation, the NCI 
statistical model, and appropriate uses of FFQ information are included in the 
References. </P>
<P>Special FFQ sample weights were produced for the FFQ subsample. Analysts 
should use the FFQ sample weights (WTS_FFQ) for all FFQ data analyses. The FFQ 
sample weights were derived from the NHANES 2003-2004 examined sample weights 
and were designed to account for FFQ non-response. Respondents with fewer than 
ten missing frequency values (i.e. FFQ_MISS &lt; 10) have an FFQ sample 
weight.</P>
<P>The NHANES Analytic Guidelines describe the recommended procedures for 
analyzing the NHANES data properly.</P>
<P><STRONG>Data Uses</STRONG></P>
<P>NCI, in collaboration with USDA/CNPP, has developed models that can be used 
to estimate population usual intake distributions and examine relationships 
between dietary intake and health outcomes. For both of these uses, the models 
depend primarily on data from 24-hour recalls, but additional covariates may be 
employed to improve the estimates. These FFQ data were collected specifically to 
be used to help estimate usual intakes of episodically consumed foods. The 
models are based on the idea that usual food intake can be expressed as the 
probability of consuming the food on a given day multiplied by the usual amount 
consumed on consumption days. While 24-hour recall data provide detailed 
information about the amount consumed on consumption days, they provide 
relatively little information about the probability to consume. Therefore the 
FFQ-based average daily frequency values from file FFQDC_C may provide useful 
covariates regarding probability to consume and hence, lead to improved 
predictions of usual intake. Here, “improved predictions” means that more of the 
variation in usual intake can be explained by observed data. Partitioning the 
variance of usual intake into explained and unexplained components is a key step 
in evaluating relationships between usual dietary intake and health outcomes 
using the statistical method known as regression calibration. However, when 
estimating a population distribution of usual intake, it is not required to 
partition the variance of usual intake, but rather to estimate it in total. 
Therefore, using FFQ-based covariates does not necessarily improve estimation 
for population usual intake distributions, and therefore may not be required for 
that purpose. </P>
<P>Furthermore, it is not recommended that these FFQ data be used alone to 
estimate absolute intakes of foods or nutrients. Such data have been shown to 
exhibit significant measurement error, making them an inappropriate choice in 
this dataset that includes 24-hour recall data. For that reason, nutrient values 
are not provided.</P>
